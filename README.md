## Current Weather App

### Assumptions

There is no requirement regarding browser support, so I have assumed only 'modern' browsers.

### Dev Environment

Chrome 63.0.3213.0, 64 bit, on Mac 10.10.

### Running the App

* Note that the app currently uses OpenWeatherMap's own sample API entry point.  Live data is throttled at one call every ten minutes.  Exceeding this using my registered App ID will result in lockouts of up to 24 hours.
